# HY-340 PROJECT PHASE 1 OUT OF 5 LEXICAL ANALYSIS


## Integrate with your tools

This project was run on a pc server that is located inside the building of
Univerity of Crete, Departement of Computer Science (CSD). The server's name
is mango. The server runs on Debian Linux.

For the creation of this project, we made extensive use of the **vim** file 
editor. We also used a **Makefile** script to automate a lot of the commands needed.
Flex was also used to create the file that was compiled, first with (lex) and the 
file made (.c file) was later compiled using (gcc). All of these tools were pre-installed
ont the server the project was created on.

## Name

 HY-340 PROJECT 
PHASE 1 OUT OF 5
LEXICAL ANALYSIS 

## Description
This phase of the project allows for the lexical analysis part of the compilation proccess
of the language (alpha). A language whose compiler we are called to completely implement as the project of the cource HY-340 (Languages and Compilers) teached by the Ph.D professor Antonis Savvidis.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Usage

For the requirments of this project phase, we used the flex tool with its compiler (lex) in order to make
the lexical analysis for our custom language (alpha)

## Support

There was **NO** support received from any third parties like other teams, stack overflow, open source code implementing lexers or AI. Everything was made using the content provided to us by the professor. The FAQ section on the cource's website, the assignment pdf as well as the front1 pdf explaining regexes and flex.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was implemented by three university students in the context of
a Phase 1 of project for the course HY-340 (Languages and Compilers)
